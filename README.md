# Kotodo

Kotodo is yet another todo list web app written in Python. However, it's with a twist not seen anywhere else.

## Requirements

1. Obviously, Python (we use 2.6.1 and 2.7.2)
2. Several Python modules:
  * bottle â€” minimalist web framework
  * mongauth - simple authentication plugin using MongoDB as a backend
  * pymongo - Python driver for MongoDB
  * py-bcrypt - cryptography module necessary for mongauth
  * isapi_wsgi - Python WSGI adapter for IIS 
3. MongoDB

That's about it!
